# Lyric Explorer

I have a passion for language learning. My favorite laid-back method of 
language study: listening to songs in the target language while reviewing
the lyrics. I want to give a fresh coat of paint to the traditional lyric
hosting website.

## What is it?

This web app connects to your music streaming platform of choice and
automatically finds the lyrics of songs you have "liked", displaying them
in a neat and tidy library for your ease of access and enjoyment.


## Goals

Once the overall look of the explorer is satisfactory, I want to:

- Embed a spotify player to play the currently displayed song from the page.
- Search and filter by: song name, artist, genre, language
- Karaoke-style word highlighting for ease of listening training/
or simply to have fun singing along!
- and possibly more...
